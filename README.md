# WeatherAPI
A web app that allows users to search for weather forecasts for a specific city


## Description 
This app allows you to enter the name of any city and get the weather for that day, as well as a 5 day forecast. I learned a lot about js functions and this project was good practice for moving inputs into and out of local storage, as well as appending items to the page. This also is my first time working with APIs and I definitely enjoyed learning how to use and manipulate the data from these databases.
